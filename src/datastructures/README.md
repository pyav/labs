# Heap
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
1. All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
2. A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap.

## Operations on a binary heap:
Following are the actions done on a min heap:
1. getMin() - O(1)
2. extractMin() - O(Log n)
3. decreaseKey() - O(Log n)
4. insertKey() - O(log n)
5. deleteKey() - O(Log n)
6. minHeapify() - O(Log n)
