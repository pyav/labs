This repository contains materials on RESTful APIs that I learn or practice. It
is meant to share knowledge on REST.

General outline of this repository is to have a README.md file for the
repository at the top directory. Any course or self-practiced/written
codes/docs will be in it's own directory (e.g. docs/Async_APIs).
