Head First Design Pattern:
-------------------------

An analogy of command pattern could be made with a waitress who takes the order
slip and gives it to the cook and notifies him/her of the order. The order slip
can be viewed as an object which has orderUp() method which has calls to the
methods of cook object based on the orders, for example, cook.makePizza(), etc.
The waitress doesn't need to know what is there in the order. Hence she could,
herself, be an object which has takeOrder() method which takes the orders from
different customers and calls orderUp() method of the order slip objects as she
knows that all the orders have orderUp() method.  This is all she needs to
know.

Codewise,

    order slip:
    ----------
    public void orderUp() {
        cook.makePizza();
        cook.makeBurger();
    }
