This repository contains materials on Spring that I learn or practice. It is meant to share knowledge on Spring.

General outline of this repository is to have a README.md file for the repository at the top directory. Any course (e.g. Coursera) or self-practiced/written codes/docs will be in it's own directory (e.g.  coursera/docs/notes). That will have it's own doc altogether.
