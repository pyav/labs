NOTE

    Only a snippet is taken from the above link and mentioned below for
    quick reference. 

Indentation
-----------
    Use 4 spaces for indentation
    
    Indentation for continuation line:
        foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two, 
		                             var_three, var_four)

    Note: There are other examples listed as recommended and not recommended on
          the above link.

    Multi-line conditional statement's distinction from its definition:
        if (this_is_one_thing and 
            that_is_another_thing):
            # Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
            do_something()

Tabs or Spaces
--------------
    Spaces are the preferred indentation method.

Maximum line length
-------------------
    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
